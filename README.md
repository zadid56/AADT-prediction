# AADT-prediction
 
An imputation based recurrent neural network model for predicting future hourly traffic volumes and AADT.

# contents
1)	Develop RNN models (using LSTM and GRU) for hourly traffic volume prediction.
2) Use imputations methods such as masking, mean, median, KNN, EM, RF, PCA, and MICE.
3) Compare with other existing time-series prediction models such as ARIMA and HES.
